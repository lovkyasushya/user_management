# User Management Repository Overview

## Introduction
The User Management repository is a comprehensive solution for managing user information within an application. This repository provides functionalities for user authentication, CRUD operations on user data, and integration with external storage using Minio. With its modular design and adherence to best practices, the repository offers a robust foundation for building user-centric applications.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a structured layout to facilitate ease of navigation and maintainability. Here's an overview of the directory structure:

- **app/**: Contains the main application code, including routers, schemas, services, and utilities.
- **tests/**: Houses the test suite for the application, ensuring reliable code quality and functionality.
- **settings/**: Stores configuration files and settings for the application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies required to run the application.

## Components
### 1. Main Application
The main application code is housed within the `app/` directory. It leverages the FastAPI framework to create a robust API for managing user data. Key components include:

- **Routers**: Defines API endpoints for user management functionalities.
- **Schemas**: Contains Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- **Services**: Implements business logic for user-related operations.
- **Utilities**: Provides helper functions and utilities to streamline application development.

### 2. Tests
The `tests/` directory hosts the test suite for the application. It includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of the codebase.

### 3. Minio Integration
The repository features integration with Minio, an open-source object storage solution. Minio is used for storing and managing user-uploaded files such as profile pictures. Key aspects of Minio integration include:

- **Purpose**: Minio enhances the application by providing scalable and reliable storage for user-generated content.
- **Integration**: Minio is seamlessly integrated into the application, allowing users to upload and retrieve files with ease.
- **Configuration**: Configuration settings for Minio are stored in the `settings/` directory, ensuring flexibility and ease of management.
- **Usage**: Developers can utilize Minio's features to store and retrieve files securely within the application.

### 4. Additional Functionality
The repository may include additional functionalities such as authentication mechanisms, email services integration, and logging capabilities. These features enhance the overall functionality and usability of the application.

# Issues faced

1. Production.yml file: By changing the github username and docker image name, and also by adding GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_TOKEN helped in resolving the issues that were causing the github actions to fail.

2. Creating auth_routes.py: 
I've created a new file named auth_routes.py to improve code organization and maintainability. In user_routes.py, we focus on managing routes related to user profile functionalities, such as creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting user profiles. On the other hand, auth_routes.py is dedicated to handling routes related to authentication tasks, including login, logout, and password management.

3. Duplicate email and nickname issues: In this particular issue, I observed that some test cases were erroneously passing despite the presence of failures, particularly concerning error code 400. Additionally, I identified issues related to duplicate emails and nicknames. To address these issues, I introduced new routes in user_routes.py and made necessary modifications in user_service.py, common.py, test_users_api.py, and test_user_service.py.

4. Locked and unverified users issues: Several issues arose regarding the verification process for new and locked users. To address these issues, I made updates to the code in both user_routes.py and user_service.py. Additionally, I expanded the test coverage by adding new test cases in test_users_api.py to thoroughly validate the verification process for new users.

5. Password Validation: I made enhancements to the code in user_schemas.py to enforce strict validation rules for passwords. Additionally, I incorporated new lines of code into user_routes.py to accommodate these changes. Furthermore, I expanded the test suite by including additional test cases in both test_user_api.py and test_user_schemas.py to thoroughly validate the password validation functionality.

6. Resolving errors in email: Changed the order of few lines of code and added few test cases beacause the user verification structure was not in order.

## New Feature: Upload pictures using Minio.
To enable users to upload and update their profile pictures, I implemented a new API endpoint. This endpoint allows users to upload their profile pictures, which are securely stored in Minio. Additionally, I updated the user profile API endpoints to include the profile picture URL. When displaying user profiles, the application retrieves the profile picture URL from Minio. These enhancements ensure that users can personalize their accounts with profile pictures while maintaining security and efficiency.

## Test cases
I have added 16 test cases in total. All these cases are added to reolve the issues that I have faced and to test if the issues got resolved or not. The above links that I have provided shows us the cases.
